# Diminished Fifth

This is the fifth project in the "A Shrinking Feeling" lineage.

This is a procedural music generation program intended for live performance.
It's written in ClojureScript, and runs in the browser using the Web Audio API.

This project is open source under the "Dude, whatever" license. I know that's not actually a license, but if you're worried about it, dude, whatever.
